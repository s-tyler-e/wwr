    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Have you ever attended a competition where 
      one team just can't seem to keep up 
      and scores a whopping Zero points? 
      Our goal at White Wash is to clean up the competition... 
      you won't find any other rafting company in our league!
      Typical rafting companies will do anything to limit their costs and maximize their profits.
      However, we at White Wash know that no expense is worth a mediocre-at-best trip, much
      less one that could prove dangerous. Our offers of two-to-five-hour adventures for fair prices
      is sure to bring you the most fun and the most safety at the least cost to you. Our
      experienced guides are trained to lead and to rescue if needs be.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>This is not for the faint of heart. With speed and splashes all the way down the river, we're aiming to please the sweet-tooth of thrillseekers 
      and would-be daredevils alike! Maybe you're a a rafting pro. 
      Maybe your a young scout looking to exceed merit-badge expectations. 
      Come one, come all to test your steel and experience excitement 
      like never before!
      A common misconception is that "thrill" equals "danger". Our staff at White Wash are highly trained and know the routes
     better than most of the fish in teh river! They are adaptable and can work with anyone from the newest scout to the most seasoned veteran.
     Choose between two, three, and four-hour rafting courses to suit your needs. Each course varies in difficulty and 
     rapid stength. No one should be left out, and therefore, we have options!</p>
